# sql-challenge
In this challenge, in the SQL file named "employee_db," both the table schemata and queries are conveniently housed. Each section within the file is meticulously labeled to differentiate between the schemata and queries, ensuring clarity and organization in the document's structure. This approach not only facilitated seamless navigation but also streamlined the process of referencing specific sections when needed, enhancing the overall efficiency of the database management tasks.
